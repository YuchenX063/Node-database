do I need the church_church table if I can directly link a small church with a big church?
searching from the big church for the small church might be a problem (?)

what do I need for the church_church table (just two ids and two years?)

does the sequence of seeders really matter? Or, can I only use one file to import data?

update the database models

repeatedly importing raw data in different seeders

???
