how to query a church by its name
(should I query a church's name through instID?)

how to design the routes (one file for all the queries of "church" or one for churchInYear and one for church)

same persID: af_ciampi_001 (Baltimore 1867 & Boston 1870) same person?

persID and persName cannot start with a hyphen (-)? (not even a hyphen)

data import is faster than django??

year (e.g., Detroit 1866, Erie 1867)

timeout error
