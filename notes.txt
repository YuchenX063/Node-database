how to design the routes (one file for all the queries of "church" or one for churchInYear and one for church);
do I need to separate findOne and fineByID

same persID: af_ciampi_001 (Baltimore 1867 & Boston 1870) same person?

persID and persName cannot start with a hyphen (-)? (not even a hyphen)

year (e.g., Detroit 1866, Erie 1867)

special characters encoding?
