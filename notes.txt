do I need the church_church table if I can directly link a small church with a big church?
searching from the big church for the small church might be a problem (?)

what do I need for the church_church table (just two ids and two years?)

does the sequence of seeders really matter?

do I need to test relationship, or just CRUD?
AND do I need to test CRUD now that my database does not ask users to create data?

running seeders before running test (then what is the point of running tests?)

data preprocess: how to do that inside this project (write another script?)
